0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:02,000
the bear and the bee.

2
0:00:04,000 --> 0:00:07,000
A version of the tale by thefablecoverage.com.

3
0:00:10,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Everybody knows that bears love honey.

4
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:16,000
One day, Mr. Bear looks in his cupboard

5
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and he can't find any honey.

6
0:00:18,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Oh no, no honey.

7
0:00:21,000 --> 0:00:25,000
He says so he goes into the forest to find some.

8
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
He sees a bee hive in a tree.

9
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:30,000
He smells the honey.

10
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:32,000
A honey.

11
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:35,000
He sticks his paw into the bee hive and...

12
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
A bee flies out.

13
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Hey Bear, go away!

14
0:00:40,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Says the bee.

15
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:42,000
This is not your honey.

16
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Mr. Bear is annoyed.

17
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I am bigger than you.

18
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:46,000
He says,

19
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and I am stronger than you too.

20
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:50,000
I can do what I want.

21
0:00:50,000 --> 0:00:51,000
No buzz off.

22
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Mr. Bear sticks his paw into the bee hive again.

23
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And...

24
0:00:58,000 --> 0:00:59,000
That's the thing.

25
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The bee stings him right on his nose.

26
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I know, I know, so I'm so angry.

27
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Grows, Mr. Bear.

28
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:11,000
He finds a big stick.

29
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
He tries to hit the bee.

30
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:14,000
He swings and he swings.

31
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But the bee is too fast.

32
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Mr. Bear gets angrier and angrier.

33
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I will squash you.

34
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Come here.

35
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Be flies back into the bee hive.

36
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Oh, no, you're tripped.

37
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The old Mr. Bear.

38
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
He swings his stick at the bee hive.

39
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Nash, smash, smash.

40
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:39,000
He smashes it to pieces and he hears a strange sound.

41
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It gets louder and louder.

42
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Thousands of bees fly out of the smashed bee hive.

43
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
They fly around Mr. Bear's head.

44
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:59,000
They sting him on his ear.

45
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:02,000
They sting him on his elbow.

46
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:05,000
They chase Mr. Bear through the forest.

47
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:07,000
They sting him on his arms.

48
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:12,000
His legs, his hands, and especially on his nose.

49
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Mr. Bear runs all the way home and slams the door shut.

50
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Bam, then he hears a voice behind him.

51
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It's Mrs. Bear.

52
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:25,000
You did it again, didn't you?

53
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:26,000
She says.

54
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
You lost your temper.

55
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Yes.

56
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
He says, as he cries and counts his bee stings.

57
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Here's the bee sting medicine.

58
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Sess Mrs. Bear.

59
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Also, we have honey in the cupboard.

60
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It's behind the flower.

61
0:02:40,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Moral.

62
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:45,000
A hot temper always gets you into trouble.
